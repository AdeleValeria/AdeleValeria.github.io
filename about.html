                    <h2>About Adele</h2>
                    <p>My name is Adele, and I hope to use my technical skills to 
                        advance immunological research through methods development, computational modeling,
                        and data analysis. I am currently a Computational Biology Ph.D. student in the 
                        Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by 
                        <a href="https://karchinlab.org/">Dr. Rachel Karchin</a>. 
                        My reserach focuses on multiomics data integration and machine learning to improve immunogenic
                        neoepitope prediction, with the goal of advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy. 
                        At present, personalized cancer vaccines are only available for a small subset of patients through
                        clinical trials, and even then, the anti-tumor immune response rates are not always robust.
                        By improving neoantigen prediction algorithms together with many other scientists in the field,
                        I hope that our collective efforts will lead to more effective and accessible cancer immunotherapies.

                        Prior to joining the Karchin Lab, I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yana-safonova/about">
                        Dr. Yana Safonova at Hopkins for a year on</a> genomics analysis of immunoglobulin loci across mammals. 
                        I earned my B.Sc. (Hons) in Biomedical Infomatics from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biomedical-sciences/connections-outreach/international-activities/zje-institute">
                        Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute</a> with a generous full-ride scholarship,
                        without which my journey in science would not have been possible. My Honours thesis was on in-silico mutagenesis
                        of KRAS protein, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/li-xianghua/">Dr. Xianghua Li</a>.
