                    <h2>About Adele</h2>
                    <p>My name is Adele, and I hope to use my technical skills to 
                        advance immunological research through methods development, computational modeling,
                        and data analysis. I am currently a Computational Biology Ph.D. student in the 
                        Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by 
                        <a href="https://karchinlab.org/">Dr. Rachel Karchin</a>. 
                        My reserach focuses on multiomics data integration and machine learning to improve immunogenic
                        neoepitope prediction, with the goal of advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy. 
                        At present, personalized cancer vaccines are only available for a small subset of patients through
                        clinical trials, and even then, the anti-tumor immune response rates are not always robust.
                        By improving neoantigen prediction algorithms together with many other scientists in the field,
                        I hope that our collective efforts will lead to more effective and accessible cancer immunotherapies.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Prior to joining the Karchin Lab, I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yana-safonova/about">
                        Dr. Yana Safonova</a> at Hopkins for a year on genomics analysis of immunoglobulin loci across mammals. 
                        I earned my B.Sc. (Hons) in Biomedical Infomatics in 2022 from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biomedical-sciences/connections-outreach/international-activities/zje-institute">
                        Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute</a>, where I was honored to receive a full scholarship 
                        that enabled me to embark on a meaningful scientific journey. My Honours thesis was on in-silico mutagenesis
                        of KRAS protein, advised by <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/li-xianghua/">Dr. Xianghua Li</a>. 
                        Previously, I also worked with <a href="https://leptihn-lab.org/the-team/leptihn/">Dr. Sebastian Leptihn</a> and 
                        <a href="https://stefanlab.net/">Dr. Melanie Stefan</a> on modelling bacteriophage adsorption. I am grateful for the guidance I have received from 
                        the various mentors I have met along the way thus far, and I look forward to growing as a scientist with the same dedication and passion that they have inspired in me.
